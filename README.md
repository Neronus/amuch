Dear github user
=============

This small piece of software connects notmuch and acme to a mail client.
It is on github mostly for backup purposes, and not yet done.
As such, consider the code protected using a terrible license that grants
you no rights whatsoever. I will release the code under a less restrictive
license once I feel confident that it works.
