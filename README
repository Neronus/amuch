This is a Mail-User-Agent written on top of notmuch and ACME.

Workflow
========

1. Searching
	To search, a user enters his search requirements (as for notmuch search), e.g., `tag:inbox'. He then selects this with
	the right mouse button (acme search query).
	A new window pops up, containing the threads that match the search, for example,
	     1			 39 mins. ago [1/6] Christian von Essen| Power, Guy H. (ARC-TI), Kimberly Salazar; Internship (attachment inbox replied todo)
	     2			 42 mins. ago [2/2] Thomas Mensink, Christian von Essen; Landlord (inbox replied)
	     3			 49 mins. ago [2/4] AGENCE PRIMA IMMOBILIER ..., Christian von Essen; Ce Week-End (inbox replied)

	    14			  Today 09:18 [1/2] Christian von Essen| von Essen, Mathias; Zahnregulierung (inbox replied)

2. Expanding Threads
	To expand a thread, the user right-clicks on a line in the new window.
	A new window pops up, containing an indented version of this thread.
	By default, only messages matching the original search query are shown.
	If the user executes ToggleMatch, all messages will be shown. Executing
	ToggleMatch goes back to the initial mode.
	
		Re: Ce Week-End
		---------------
	
	     1			"AGENCE PRIMA IMMOBILIER ..." <primaimmobilier@yahoo.fr
	     2			  Christian von Essen <christian@mvonessen.de>
	     3			    "AGENCE PRIMA IMMOBILIER ..." <primaimmobilier@yahoo.fr> 
	     4			      Christian von Essen <christian@mvonessen.de> 
	
3. Viewing an email
	Again, right-clicking on any of these messages will open up a new window, showing the message.
	The line of the message we just opened will be hilighted.


4. Tagging messages
	The user can always execute +tag or -tag to add or remove tags.
	In the message window, the tag will be applied to the message
	In the thread window, the tag will be applied to all threads
	in the window that are displayed (i.e., behaviour depends on
	ToggleMatch), if no text is active. Otherwise, the tag will be
	applied to all messages that are touched by the region.


5. Composing and replying emails
	The user can always execute NewMessage to pop up a window to send
	a new message.	The user can always execute Reply to set up a
	new window for replying to a message.  If no text is selected,
	then the reply will be sent to everybody. Otherwise, the reply
	will be sent to whatever text is selected.

	
6. Attachments
	Adding messages and downloading/opening attachments it TBD, but most likely:
	Downloading/adding:
		We display non-text attachments as
		[ image/jpg foo.jpg ].
		We provide functions Open and Save which will look for a filename
		with the current dot. If so, it will try to open/save
		the file.  Save takes as argument either a folder or a
		filename to save it as.  If multiple lines are selected,
		we try everything that looks like a filename.  We escape
		filenames containing whitespace via the usual backslash.
